We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
About Wealthfront
Our first chapter was about transforming the investment advisory business. We focused on unlocking access to low cost investing for delegators - people who were underserved by high fee and human financial advisors. We built the first automated portfolio that allows you in seconds to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies for a remarkably low fee, which resulted in attracting more than $25 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry.
Now, we’ve embarked on expanding into an adjacent opportunity to transform the digital self-directed brokerage space. This focus enables us to empower a dramatically wider audience to build long-term wealth - people who are eager to learn about investing by making their own investment decisions, but need guidance. In the last few years, several financial technology companies have made it incredibly accessible and engaging to trade in individual stocks, but because of their transaction based business models, these apps keep people focused on the day-to-day gyrations of the market leading to short-term thinking and behaviors. As a result, millions of people are investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks which is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We believe our vision serves their needs far better and that we can extend our core philosophy of embracing diversification, managing risk, minimizing fees and taxes and taking a long-term view, into self-directed investing. We believe this is an ideal opportunity to leverage our strength of building simple, easy-to-use products that offer a delightfully engaging experience to build long-term wealth.",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=f436958b48febacf&fccid=90344e51e9e06acc&vjs=3

Diversity Statement
We're equally committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplace and in how we show up in this world. To us, diversity means recognizing that different views and experiences are as important as those we're already familiar with. It means taking radical ownership of the things we affect as individuals and as a company - including even inherited ways of doing things which may be destructive or biased and which we must work to change. It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list.
This is how we strive to practice We define diversity as making sure (1) our table represents people from varying backgrounds, (2) inclusion as making sure our people have a seat at the table, and (3) equity as making sure our people have the same means to get to the table in the first place. Externally, we apply the same policies to partnerships, marketing, and product development.
Ultimately, diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love, or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

That's why we're here!

When you join Brightline, you're joining a team that has an unstoppable drive to change the lives of families across the country. We're a team of thoughtful problem-solvers, expert and kind clinicians, and experienced operators and technologists.

You will collaborate to build proactive insight tools that can alert different stakeholders to important analyses based on business logic, statistical analysis and eventually supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to proactive, scalable insight sharing.
You will collaborate with other data scientists on code reviews and pairing to keep our quality bar high.

And here are the kinds of projects you might work on in your first few months:

Help establish self-serve web/mobile analytics
Build dashboards for the most important success metrics in emerging areas like mobile
Identify opportunities for a few quick wins on scalable, alert-based analytics and implement if the impact seems high.
Collaborate on A/B testing strategy and execution. This includes deciding when A/B testing is right and how to make sure it supports our decision-making.

About you:

You have strong analytic skills and experience with problem framing, metric design, metric implementation, and dashboard creation.
You have strong coding for analytics use-cases in SQL, R, Python, Julia, Scala or similar (and flexibility about languages and tools).

To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them.
