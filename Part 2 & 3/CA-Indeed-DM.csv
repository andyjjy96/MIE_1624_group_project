Consequence of Error/Judgement

The results of data analysis, reports and research will be used in formulating policy, making decisions relating to the future of graduate education at the university, and evaluating the effectiveness of programs and policies and assist in data driven decision making for resource allocation. Hence errors in design, interpretation or analysis of research could have far reaching consequences. The validity of these decisions is therefore dependent upon comparability, reliability, statistical significance, representation, corroboration, and construct validity of the survey research. Errors could result in inefficient resource allocation, the continuation of poor practices, poor advice to administrators, reputational risks, and have adverse effects on morale and public relations. Any errors and/or omissions in judgment could seriously undermine the roles, responsibilities and effectiveness of The Dean and/or G+PS. Errors in the maintenance of compliance with data security and privacy policies could lead to data breaches which could compromise the privacy of past and current graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and the integrity and trustworthiness of G+PS and UBC.

Works with wide latitude. Work is reviewed in terms of achievement of high professional standards in the delivery of data and statistical analysis services and broad project objectives and goals.

AT ADIDAS WE HAVE A WINNING CULTURE. BUT TO WIN, PHYSICAL POWER IS NOT ENOUGH. JUST LIKE ATHLETES OUR EMPLOYEES NEED MENTAL STRENGTH IN THEIR GAME. WE FOSTER THE ATHLETE‘S MINDSET THROUGH A SET OF BEHAVIORS THAT WE WANT TO ENABLE AND DEVELOP IN OUR PEOPLE AND THAT ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR UNIQUE COMPANY CULTURE – THE 3CS: CONFIDENCE, COLLABORATION AND CREATIVITY.
CONFIDENCE allows athletes to make quick decisions on the field, to reach higher. For us at adidas confidence means acknowledging that we don’t have all the answers. But we are willing to take risks, we try new things. And if we fail, then this is part of our learning – it helps us improve.
COLLABORATION. Every elite athlete relies on partners: coaches, teammates, and nutritionists. We, too, know that we are stronger together. Winning as one team takes open and candid dialogue, inclusiveness and trust in each other’s abilities and talents.
Being the best sports company in the world takes CREATIVITY. No great athlete succeeds by copying their predecessors’ training plans and strategies. We have to be open to new ideas, explore, gain an edge and stand out. Only then can we succeed.
ADIDAS CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, SUPPORTS INCLUSIVENESS AND ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION IN OUR WORKPLACE. WE DO NOT TOLERATE THE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION TOWARD ANY OF OUR APPLICANTS OR EMPLOYEES. WE ARE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

About Viamo
Mobile technology is revolutionizing how organizations engage with their end users. More than 96% of the world's population has access to a mobile phone, meaning it is now possible to reach nearly every single person on the planet. Yet 3 billion people living in emerging markets still lack access to relevant, timely, and engaging information in their local languages, and their voices remain underheard. The organizations that serve them lack the technology and capacity to reach them, and many are unaware of the power of mobile technology to meet their organizational goals.
Viamo connects individuals and organizations using digital technology to make better decisions.
With more than 30 million people reached in 2020 alone, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of reaching 50 million people annually by 2023.
About the role
Viamo's services deliver essential life-improving information to millions of people per month in 30+ countries around the world, and connect companies and organizations to have stronger relationships with the hard-to-reach customers they serve. Our technology teams work within empowered Product Crews to create the communication products that make this happen. As an Engineering Manager and chapter lead for Data, your job is to lead and grow the people, tools, and systems in all Crews for maximum effectiveness in storing, structuring, harnessing, securing, and extracting insights from data - now and for the long-term.
About You

HR research shows that men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, but women and other under-represented people often apply only if they feel they check 100% of the requirements. We would love to see your application even if you don't feel you hit every point below.

Architecture effectiveness: As an expert on data systems, you would be responsible for the effectiveness of architecture choices on new product development, and upgrades to existing systems. Rather than creating architecture exclusively by yourself, we're counting on you to enable ""distributed architecture"" by mentoring and building this skill set within Engineering Leads and other developers within Product Crews.
Engineering Roadmap strategy: Working with your Data Chapter, you would be responsible for curating and prioritizing the backlog for the Engineering Roadmap. (We target 30% of total developer time on Engineering Roadmap items: boosting future capacity, library upgrades, addressing tech debt, next-generation data technologies, etc.)

This role will report into the Senior Manager, Strategy & Operations PDV.

Working with GMs to review KPIs and help identify opportunities to better manage their businesses, make quicker decisions and share best practices.

Data products and businesses are very nascent at Bain. Through your work, you will be shaping Bain’s approach to building and commercializing data products. As a result, the Strategy & Operations Manager must have an entrepreneurial, continuous improvement mindset and constantly identify new opportunities to accelerate venture growth. This will lead to new strategic initiatives.

In only seven years, and with a team of over 75% women, Mejuri has shipped over one million orders and opened eight retail stores across the globe, all while introducing new products weekly.
Admired for its inherently timeless yet playful aesthetic and beloved 14k gold products, Mejuri is Series B funded and backed by VC investors such as Natalie Massenet’s Imaginary Ventures, NEA and Felix Capital.
