Job Profile Title
Programmer Junior

Job Description Summary
Data Analyst Junior

As part of the Department of Psychiatry, the Neurodevelopment & Psychosis Section, the Lifespan Brain Institute (LiBI) and the Brain Behavior Laboratory (BBL) are devoted to the study of brain and behavior throughout the lifespan. We use: 1) innovative neuroimaging techniques, and 2) the application of cutting-edge psychometric and bioinformatics resources. The Data Analyst Junior will provide support for managing and analyzing data within the lab of Drs. Ruben and Raquel Gur.

Job Description

The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the oldest and one of the finest medical schools in the United States. Penn is rich in tradition and heritage and at the same time consistently at the forefront of new developments and innovations in medical education and research. Since its founding in 1765 the School has been a strong presence in the community and prides itself on educating the leaders of tomorrow in patient care, biomedical research, and medical education. http://www.med.upenn.edu/ .

Data Analyst Junior

We are seeking a full-time Data Analyst Junior to join our team immediately. This position offers a highly interdisciplinary research experience, combining approaches from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, psychiatry, and statistics with neuroimaging. The applicant will have the opportunity to participate in major methodological and analytic developments, publications, and presentations.

Responsibilities will include supporting principal investigators, fellows, and technical staff with in-depth analyses using multiple complex datasets. While the position is entry-level (i.e. recent college graduates are encouraged to apply!), the analyst will work closely with a PhD-level statistician/psychometrician to climb very steep learning curves quickly. The analyst will thereby acquire an unusually advanced skillset compared to most entry-level positions. For this reason, we are especially seeking applicants with long-term career goals in statistics or psychometrics.

Example tasks might include being asked to:
1. Determine the statistical effects of missing data and compare the results of some available imputation methods (maximum likelihood, random forest, etc.).

2. Determine the number of latent dimensions underlying a data set and apply factor analysis and item response theory to estimate model parameters for such uses as computerized adaptive testing and analysis of item bias.

3. Demonstrate (visually) a statistical effect in several different ways (e.g. using panels versus color-coding).

4. Link a list of physical street addresses to geocodes and link those geocodes to census data from multiple years.

5. Simulate item responses with other variables to determine how many Likert response categories are likely to be necessary on a personality scale with a specific number of items.

The applicant is not expected to be familiar with the above-s/he will be taught-but it is important that at least some of the above procedures seem interesting to the applicant.

Other duties might include: performing data management functions like extracting, importing, and exporting data from various in-house applications; restructuring and/or merging datasets; assisting with user documentation; running queries on datasets using SQL; preparing datasets for analyses; resolving data inconsistencies; and taking responsibility for completeness and quality of multiple data sets.

Qualifications

Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Physics, Statistics, Neuroscience or Experimental Psychology and 0-1 year of experience or equivalent combination of education and experience required. A Bachelor's or Master's degree and 1-2 years of research preferred. Applicants with a relevant major (psychology, statistics, economics, computer science, biology, or neuroscience) will be given preference, and applicants with relevant long-term career goals (e.g. professor of statistics, entrepreneur in the machine learning industry, etc.) are especially preferred.

Preferred Skills:
R, Python, SPSS syntax, Stata, or another script-based statistical package. Job will involve mostly R.

Background check required. Position contingent on funding.

Physical Effort

250,Data Analyst,"Remote in Chicago, IL 60654 60654",Data Analyst (Remote),Fetch Rewards,"What we're building and why we're building it.

Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years we've grown from 0 to 7M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with brands.

It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the ""you get to use our product!"" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps.

Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers. - Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?

That's why we're building the world's rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands.

Fetch Rewards is an equal employment opportunity employer.

The Role!

The Data Science & Analytics team embodies these values and works with a laser focused objective to enable data driven decision making for both internal stakeholders and external partners. We are looking for a Data Analyst to contribute to this vision and reap the rewards of joining an exciting company in the high growth phase.

You will create analytical solutions that help Fetch teams leverage and monetize actionable insights from our unique data. This is a challenging and high visibility position, responsible for creating these solutions as well as influencing technical direction.
