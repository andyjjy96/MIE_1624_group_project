Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as Los Angeles Metro, San Antonio Metro, Grab, and Calgary Transit.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.


RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. At RideCo, we celebrate diversity, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our customers, our products, and our community. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be.

If you are excited about joining a fast-growing insurtech innovator with a passion for excellence and global culture, Shift is the place for you.

Shift Technology offers a unique opportunity to brilliant candidates to accelerate their careers in data science

Data scientists work on a broad range of subjects, acquiring a lot of technical and professional experience in data science, data engineering, coding, business understanding and client interactions; skills invaluable in any career.

We are a fast growing company, the best contributors will grow to managerial or product tech lead positions much more rapidly than in bigger companies


YOUR ROLE

The data science team is in charge of technically delivering the Shift products to clients, the key role in the success of our projects with clients. It is a hands-on job, expect to be doing everything you can imagine from the technical side in an AI company:

Implementation of the data engineering, usually from client extracts to the insertion of the data in our data stores (SQL, ElasticSearch)
Developing, testing, tuning models and putting them in production for tasks such as fraud detection and automation detection in complex environments.
Automate key business tasks by implementing them in our production process framework in C#
Conduct meetings with clients and interact with external stakeholders, whether it is direct user feedback, presenting business cases or defining the roadmap of evolutions for that client

You will actively participate in the definition and development of our suite of products on fraud detection, anti-money laundering and claim automation, working on various data types such as structured data, free text, documents and images.

Writing scripts for models and notebooks is not enough at Shift, we thrive on people who can write maintainable, production-quality code that will run everyday without breaking.
AI-savvy, either by having a degree in machine learning and/or statistics or be looking to work on those subjects. Having a clear understanding of statistics and machine learning problems, tasks and common resolutions is important to communicate internally and explain to the client how the product is working.
Client facing. You will need to be comfortable, clear and professional when talking to clients during meetings and by email. Expect to talk with a client every other day and grow your communicational and presentational skills!
Business smart. We don't expect candidates to know the insurance sector, but we want people who can learn and master the business aspects of our products

219,219,Alloy,"About Alloy
At Alloy, we work with consumer goods companies that make the products we eat, wear, and use every day, as well as the ones we occasionally splurge on. We’re tackling a real and complex problem for them—managing supply and demand in the face of constantly changing customer behavior, highly complex supply chain networks, 40-year-old data standards and labor-intensive manual processes.
Alloy is a fast-growing, well-funded startup with expanding offices across the world. Our team hails from successful startups, leading tech companies and Fortune 100 enterprises. We believe deeply in fostering individual ownership, iterating to excellence, focusing on what matters, communicating openly & respectfully, and supporting one another.
We encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. Alloy is committed to creating an inclusive culture, and we celebrate diversity of all kinds.
About the role
As a data scientist at Alloy, you will be at the forefront of helping our customers forecast their true demand. The forecasts you build will lead directly to real world decisions, like how much product is manufactured and where it is shipped to. Accurate forecasts drive short-term replenishment decisions, form the backbone of demand planning, and inform portfolio and sales strategies - all key parts for operating a modern supply chain efficiently and sustainably!

Together with the forecasting team, you will own forecasting end-to-end. The team's ownership ranges from building and maintaining our forecasting models and pipeline to measuring the performance of the resulting predictions all the way to the frontend. Your main focus will be data science, but there is also an opportunity to grow beyond that role and venture into frontend and backend development.

You will provide thought leadership for forecasting best practices and standards both internally and with customers. You're comfortable with ownership - together with the team, you will help define the vision and roadmap for the forecasting efforts at Alloy. Our data engineering team takes care of wrangling and storing the supply chain data among all the different partners our customers work with - you will have terabytes of readily usable, clean data at your disposal.
We're looking for self-starters who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. We’ve grown our staff significantly in the past year, and as a rapidly expanding startup, there’s plenty of opportunity to make an impact and develop your career.
About you:
3+ years of experience with time series forecasting and statistical modeling in a production environment, ideally in a supply chain related industry
Strong communication skills - ability to identify the knowledge and needs of their audience, and adapt the communication based on it
A passion for data and a drive to challenge the status quo and find better ways to make predictions
A “growth mindset” and tolerance for ambiguity; you don’t easily give up and always try to iterate to excellence
Strong Python skills; strong knowledge of common data science libraries/frameworks such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy; excitement about picking up new technologies as needed
Excitement to work in a cross-functional team
Experience with ETL pipelines
As a plus:
Experience with R and SQL
Experience in Java, or Typescript / React
What you'll get for joining
Base salary $85,000 - $165,000 CAD
Substantial equity package
Flexible vacation policy
Support from highly experienced mentors
Genuine and welcoming teammates
Comprehensive health coverage
Monthly team events
Fully stocked snack-shelf
Paid parental leave
Our engineering culture emphasizes code reviews, mentorship, and collaboration. We foster individual ownership of engineering work across the team and lean on each others' strengths when needed.

Our values
Focus on what matters: Reevaluate priorities as necessary to pick the work that will have the highest impact to the customer and business. Work hard in a way that is sustainable. Choose the schedule that lets you achieve your best. Measure results, not hours. Respect your time and that of others; come prepared and leave with commitments.
Take ownership: Take initiative by proactively identifying opportunities or issues and tackling them. Strive for excellence. Hold yourself and your colleagues to a high standard. Create something that makes you proud. Follow through on our commitments to customers, users, and each other. We are all doers, regardless of role — no task is beneath you.
Iterate to excellence: Prefer action over perfection to learn quickly from early feedback. Be flexible and accept the need to make tradeoffs and change directions. Everything is a work in progress, nothing is done. Question prevailing assumptions, but understand them first. Gather evidence and champion ideas that will make our products and our company better. Verify and validate.
Communicate openly and respectfully: Offer and expect transparency to build trust. Confirm mutual understanding, especially in the face of disagreement. Treat each other with respect. Criticize constructively — the work, not the person.
Have each other’s back: When interacting with each other, always assume good intentions. Trust each other and take risks together. Give praise generously and take joy in others’ accomplishments. Grow a diverse team by actively seeking different backgrounds and cultivating an inclusive culture. Focus on how others’ strengths compliment us, rather than how their weaknesses invalidate them.",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=579554f7524ca5e7&fccid=17deafb845ac1078&vjs=3,"Vancouver, BC",Data Scientist,Data Scientist
