These issues include, but are not limited to, ending so-called “conversion therapy,” advocating for every school in the United States to adopt LGBTQ-inclusive suicide prevention policies, expanding the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data, engaging federal partners and leading efforts to implement the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988), and fighting against state-level bills targeting transgender and nonbinary youth. The Advocacy Manager will support the Advocacy team by tracking and analyzing legislation on mental health and suicide prevention; attending coalition and partnership meetings that impact The Trevor Project’s policy priorities; and will occasionally make recommendations for or against state or federal bills. The Advocacy Manager is a catalyst of change, ensuring that LGBTQ youth’s lives are saved because of their support, tenacity, and foresight.

Culturally competent. You have a nuanced understanding of the experiences of LGBTQ folks. You are passionate and willing to learn more about the marginalized identities, and bring your awareness to all the work you do.
Visionary builder. You are someone who thinks strategically. You are excited about the opportunity to take the status quo as just a starting point, then implement best practices and continually innovate.
Goal-oriented. You set measurable and achievable goals, then focus on exceeding them.
Flexible. You are comfortable navigating ambiguity and working through competing priorities.
Passionate. You care about LGBTQ youth. You care about supporting LGBTQ youth in crisis. You want to come to work and feel inspired every day. You want to change the world.

Job Description
 What’s the role?
The Research Operations team at Etsy is looking for a Research Coordinator to join our growing team and support several key areas to help us scale the impact of research.

As our team grows, we’re looking for a Research Coordinator to join our small but mighty Research Operations team to further support our culture of continuous learning. In this role, you’ll own logistics for both our Product and Market research teams, and recruiting and maintaining a healthy pipeline of participants for a variety of research studies. Put simply, you’ll keep the train rolling, and we can’t imagine how we’d do it without you.
As a Research Coordinator, you’ll support the team throughout the research lifecycle from end-to-end recruiting, screening, and scheduling efforts to streamlining research operations and team communications. You’ll manage relationships with existing external partners and vendors, and stay up to date on new industry tools and trends to vet and onboard new vendors or processes when needed.

Understanding recruit needs, and drafting and programming tailored screeners
Recruiting customers from our research participant database
Managing the A-Z of logistics to keep research projects on track, such as:
Owning schedules and communications with researchers and partner teams
Coordinating day-of logistics for testing days
Tracking and managing research operational items (e.g. NDAs, gift cards, facilities requests)
Managing external partners and vendors
Collaborating closely with recruitment vendors to recruit prospective buyers and sellers
Identifying and vetting outside research partners, vendors, and tools for the team
Owning the internal procurement and approval process (working closely with legal and finance)

Creating and updating resources
Crafting team documentation for a variety of topics ranging from team values to the recruiting process
Auditing team operations and processes to identify areas of improvement
Developing instructions and/or training materials for various tools and tasks
Keeping resources up-to-date
Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy's discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.

Qualifications
Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:
Your natural curiosity, empathy, and eagerness to learn drive everything you do
Some might say you’re hyper-organized, detail-obsessed, and take pride in efficiency.
You're interested in identifying workflow inefficiencies, and optimizing or improving processes and operations. We’d love to learn from you about how to better our workflows and tools.

Experience with or interest in learning:
Spreadsheet / Database software, such as Excel / Google Sheets (vlookups, pivot tables), SQL, etc

Tracking and managing research operational items (e.g. NDAs, gift cards, facilities requests)
Managing external partners and vendors
Collaborating closely with recruitment vendors to recruit prospective buyers and sellers
